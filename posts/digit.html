            <p>I have been obsessed with personal finance since I got my first bit of cash at my Bar Mitzvah. I invested most of this money and by age 15 I had seen my net worth triple and then go to 0, thanks to the Internet and telecom bubbles.This early experience of managing my own money set me on a lifelong journey in search of the truths underlying the financial realm. <br><br>This journey eventually led to a BSBA in finance (University of Florida), where I was a finance research assistant (<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1361844&amp;ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">published</a>) then a Fixed Asset accountant at Lockheed Martin (<a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/mr-bean-rowan-atkinson-h9QalBGFMO2I?ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">Mr. Fun</a>), where I started a video show on Finance (<a href="http://www.thewaytobuildwealth.org/?ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">TWTBW</a>), which led led me to my first real job (Marketing) working for a financial startup (<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cakefinancial?ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">Cake Financial</a>).<br><br>Through these experiences, a truth I kept wrestling with was the disconnect between the information available to help people make good financial decisions and the actual decisions people were making with their money. When I look around I see people, including myself, being inefficient and irrational with money decisions and yet there&#8217;s a book, article, paper somewhere detailing exactly what should be done to maximize financial health.<br><br>I thought the problem was that the information wasn't getting properly packaged for a broad enough audience, hence my creation of TWTBW and my job at Cake Financial.<br><br>When the economy hit hard times in 2008, I got laid off from Cake Financial. This led to founding <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flowtown?ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">Flowtown</a>, a marketing company. I was on the cutting edge of video and social marketing so it was a skill I could immediately cash-in, while the economy was crashing, to cover my bills. Flowtown blossomed into a marketing software company that grew to a customer base of 26,000 businesses and an eventual acquisition by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/demandforce?ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">Demandforce</a> for $4.5M in 2011. 8 months later Demandforce would be acquired by Intuit for $425M.<br><br>Once the dust finally settled on all the acquisitions, I had the space and freedom to go back, dig up my troubling financial truth and arrive at a brand new realization. For the first time in my life I could see that the problem wasn't the delivery mechanism of financial information, it was the expectation that people would give a shit. Not everyone is a finance nerd like me and not everyone should have to be in order to have financial stability.<br><br>So while in the shower one day in January 2012, I made the commitment to spend the rest of my life tackling the problems of modern financial management from this fresh perspective. I wanted to answer a question I found no one else was asking: &#8220;How could we help people maximize their money, while at the same time driving the amount of time and effort it takes to do so as close to 0 minutes per year as possible.&#8221;<br><br>In November 2012 I left my job at Demandforce/Intuit and the next day I started hacking and trying to answer this question. <a href="http://westcoasttechmeetseastcoasthustle.com/post/43974212965/the-dark-side-of-creating?ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">Five prototypes</a>, many <a href="http://westcoasttechmeetseastcoasthustle.com/post/38377782774/learning-to-breath?ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">sleepless nights</a> and <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdigit.co%2Fabout&amp;t=NmQwZDNiZmM0ZmFmYTJkMTEyNTcyODA2NjkxYjNmYjRiZWIyZjljYyw0NGUxYWRmNTRkNGQwNGZkZDVhMmVkMTQ3MzRlOGM5NWQ0MzZkMTc5&amp;ts=1730178088&amp;ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">three incredible teammates</a> (Todd Larsen, Chris Wilson, and Michael Murray) later we arrived at an answer and a very early version of <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdigit.co&amp;t=N2UzMDE0ZDk3NWFmMmU5ZWZjNjA1NmU2MmZjMDJkMDI2MzkyNGVkMSxlZjA0MDgxMzM4YWU1ODYwNTJlMGMyNmI3Yjg4ZWEwNTBiNmZmNmFm&amp;ts=1730178088&amp;ref=ethan-bloch.ghost.io">Digit</a> &#8212; a service that automates your savings so you don&#8217;t have to think about it.<br><br>Our longterm goal at Digit is to make all the complicated financial services in your life automated, intuitive, and intelligent.
